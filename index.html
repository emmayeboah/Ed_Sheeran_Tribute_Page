      <p>I found a love for me</p>
      <p>Darling, just dive right in</p>
      <p>And follow my lead</p>
      <p>Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet</p>
      <p>I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
      <p>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
      <p>Not knowing what it was</p>
      <p>I will not give you up this time</p>
      <p>Darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own</p>
      <p>And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
      <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms</p>
      <p>Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song</p>
      <p>When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</p>
      <p>But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
      <p>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know</p>
      <p>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home</p>
      <p>I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
      <p>To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>
      <p>We are still kids, but we're so in love</p>
      <p>Fightin' against all odds</p>
      <p>I know we'll be alright this time</p>
      <p>Darling, just hold my hand</p>
      <p>Be my girl, I'll be your man</p>
      <p>I see my future in your eyes</p>
      <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms</p>
      <p>Barefoot on the grass, listenin' to our favorite song</p>
      <p>When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful</p>
      <p>I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
      <p>Oh, no, no</p>
      <p>Mm</p>
      <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms</p>
      <p>Barefoot on the grass, we're listenin' to our favorite song</p>
      <p>I have faith in what I see</p>
      <p>Now I know I have met an angel in person</p>
      <p>And she looks perfect</p>
      <p>No, I don't deserve this</p>
      <p><em>You look perfect tonight</em></p>
